# How does Storybook work?

The general idea is reduce the redundant code and make it easier to reuse the same components.

For example, if you want to reuse the same button with different colors, you can create a button component and pass the color as a prop and 
if you want to reuse a header component with different sizes, you can pass the size as a prop. Which can be applied to templated pages too, that
is a combination of components.
